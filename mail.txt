Hi,

I am the best person for this job. I am a frontend developer based out of Bangalore India.
My LinkedIn profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneeshdata/
My Github account : https://github.com/varadan13

I am currently working in an Australian startup called Kravein.
Kravein website : https://www.kravein.com.au/

I am the maintainer of this website. This website is build using NextJs.

I am good with NodeJs as well. Using NodeJs I have build scripts that helped me create the sitemap of the above website. And also used it in creating graphql APIs.
I have used NestJs in my previous work

Neat and clean code is guaranteed by me because I am just building my reputation in this portal and every client matters to me a lot



Do you use AI coding tools in your coding practice? If so, which ones?
I use Cursor, Preplexity and ChatGPT for my coding.

I have used Cursor to read through the source code of libraries like HTMx, Preact/Signals, etc

For example using Cursor and after spending some considerable amount of time in the HTMx codebase I understood that the below code represent the core Idea of the library

```js
const elt = document.querySelector("#source")

elt.addEventListener("click", async () => {
const get = elt.getAttribute("hx-get")
const target = elt.getAttribute("hx-target")
fetch(get).then(res => res.text()).then(html => {
const targetElt = document.querySelector(target)
targetElt.innerHTML = html
})

})
```

I use VSCode with no AI integration to maintain my coding mind sharp and use these AI tools for tangential coding activities like researching, study, making study plans, etc
